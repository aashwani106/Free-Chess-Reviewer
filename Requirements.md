1. Core Objective
Create a system that automatically analyzes Chess.com games by:

Accepting a game URL from users

Using headless browser automation to:

Login to Chess.com

Navigate to the specified game

Trigger game analysis

Extract analysis data

2. Technical Requirements
Frontend (Next.js)
Input Form:

URL validation for Chess.com game links

Loading states/status indicators

Error handling for invalid URLs

Results Display:

Section to show analysis (PGN, graphs, moves)

Error messages for failed analyses

Backend (Next.js API Routes)
Headless Browser Automation:

Use Puppeteer/Playwright

Implement stealth plugins to avoid bot detection

Authentication System:

Secure credential storage (environment variables)

Login workflow automation

Game Analysis Workflow:

Navigation to user-provided URL

DOM interaction with "Game Review" button

Analysis data scraping

Security:

Input sanitization for game URLs

Rate limiting (e.g., 5 requests/minute/user)

Timeout handling (30-60s max per request)

Infrastructure
Deployment Platform:

Requires Node.js support (not suitable for serverless/Vercel)

Recommended: Dedicated server (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean)

Resource Management:

Concurrent browser instance limits

Memory/CPU monitoring

3. Key Dependencies
markdown
Copy
- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- Puppeteer/Playwright (+ stealth plugin)
- Redis/BullMQ (for job queuing)
- Zod (input validation)
- Dotenv (environment management)
4. Workflow Diagram
Copy
User Input -> Frontend -> API Route -> Job Queue -> Headless Browser -> 
Chess.com Login -> Game Navigation -> Analysis Trigger -> Data Extraction -> 
Results Cache -> Response to User
5. Security Considerations
Credential Protection:

Never hardcode credentials

Use server-side environment variables

Input Validation:

Regex pattern for Chess.com URLs

Block non-game URLs (e.g., /user/ paths)

Anti-Bot Measures:

Random delays between actions

Human-like mouse movements

Regular selector updates

6. Error Handling Scenarios
Scenario	Solution
Login Failure	Retry mechanism (3 attempts)
Missing Game Review Button	Fallback XPath/CSS selectors
Analysis Timeout	Progressive timeout strategy
Rate Limit Detection	IP-based cooldown period
7. Performance Optimization
Browser Pooling: Reuse browser instances

Caching: Store results for 24 hours

Parallelization: Queue system for concurrent requests

Memory Management: Strict browser instance cleanup

8. Deployment Checklist
Server Requirements:

Minimum 4GB RAM

Node.js 18+

Chrome headless dependencies

Environment Variables:

env
Copy
CHESSCOM_EMAIL=your@email.com
CHESSCOM_PASSWORD=securepassword
REDIS_URL=redis://...
Maintenance Plan:

Weekly selector validation

Credential rotation schedule

9. Alternative Approaches
If headless browsers prove unreliable:

Chess.com Official API (limited access)

PGN Parsing + Stockfish Integration

Lichess API Integration (alternative platform)

10. Development Milestones
Phase 1: Basic Automation (2 weeks)

Login + Game Navigation

Phase 2: Data Extraction (1 week)

PGN Download

Basic Analysis Capture

Phase 3: Production Readiness (1 week)

Error Handling

Rate Limiting
